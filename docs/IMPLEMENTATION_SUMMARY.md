## Key Features Delivered

### 1. Unified Provider Interface
```elixir
# Single interface for all providers
ProviderAdapter.stream_chat(request, on_event)
# Automatically handles provider selection, failover, retries, and circuit breaking
```

### 2. Automatic Failover
```elixir
# Configurable failover strategies
ProviderFactory.create_failover_group(
  "chat-service",
  ["openai-main", "anthropic-main"], 
  %{strategy: :round_robin, max_attempts: 3}
)
```

### 3. Circuit Breaker Protection
```elixir
# Per-provider circuit breakers with configurable thresholds
CircuitBreakerManager.register_provider("openai", %{
  failure_threshold: 5,
  recovery_timeout: 60_000
})
```

### 4. Intelligent Retry Logic
```elixir
# Exponential backoff with jitter
RetryPolicy.with_retry(operation, %{
  max_attempts: 3,
  base_delay_ms: 1000,
  backoff_factor: 2.0,
  jitter: true
})
```

### 5. Comprehensive Telemetry
```elixir
# Real-time metrics and health monitoring
health = ProviderAdapter.get_provider_health()
metrics = ProviderAdapter.get_provider_metrics()
```

### 6. Cost Optimization
```elixir
# Multi-provider cost estimation
costs = ProviderFactory.estimate_costs(request)
# => %{"openai" => 0.0002, "anthropic" => 0.0003}
```
