# Runestone v0.6.1 Release Notes

## 🚀 Release Highlights

**Production-Ready LLM Gateway with Full Database Support**

This release marks a significant milestone for Runestone, delivering a fully operational, production-ready LLM gateway with comprehensive database integration and background job processing capabilities.

## ✨ What's New

### Database & Persistence Layer
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Full database connectivity enabled via Ecto ORM
- **Oban Job Processing**: Background task processing for overflow handling and async operations
- **Persistent Storage**: API keys, metrics, and request history now persistable

### Production Improvements
- **Dagger CI/CD Integration**: Successfully dogfooded with Apollo Dagger for containerized builds
- **Health Monitoring**: Enhanced health endpoints with database and Oban status checks
- **Production Build**: Optimized Elixir release created with `MIX_ENV=prod`

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Build Information
- **Build Tool**: Dagger v0.18.14
- **Container**: Elixir 1.16 base image
- **Release Path**: `_build/prod/rel/runestone`
- **Architecture**: Multi-stage Docker build with production optimizations

### System Requirements
- PostgreSQL 15+ (tested with v15.13)
- Elixir 1.15+
- Erlang/OTP 26+
- 512MB minimum RAM
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

## 📊 Testing & Validation

### Dogfooding Results
✅ **API Endpoints**: All OpenAI-compatible endpoints operational
✅ **Streaming**: SSE streaming with proper `[DONE]` markers
✅ **Database**: Connection pool healthy, migrations applied
✅ **Job Queue**: Oban processing overflow requests successfully
✅ **Circuit Breakers**: All providers in closed (healthy) state
✅ **Memory Usage**: Stable at ~72MB under normal load

### Provider Status
- **Anthropic**: ✅ Fully configured and operational
- **OpenAI**: ⚠️ Requires API key configuration
- **Rate Limiting**: Functional with configurable per-tenant limits

## 🚀 Deployment

### Quick Start
```bash
# Using the release binary
_build/prod/rel/runestone/bin/runestone start

# Or with Docker
docker run -p 4003:4003 -p 4004:4004 \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/db \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key \
  runestone:v0.6.1
```

### Configuration
- Main API Port: 4003 (configurable via `PORT`)
- Health Check Port: 4004 (configurable via `HEALTH_PORT`)
- Database: Configure via `DATABASE_URL` or individual env vars

## 🔄 Migration Guide

If upgrading from v0.6.0:
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running
2. Run database migrations: `mix ecto.migrate`
3. Update your configuration to include database credentials
4. Restart the application

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Rate limiter shows as "error" in health check until first request
- OpenAI provider shows "warning" without API key (non-blocking)
- Some compilation warnings related to unused variables (cosmetic)

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This release was successfully built and tested using:
- **Dagger**: For containerized CI/CD pipeline
- **Apollo GraphQL**: For Dagger MCP integration
- **PostgreSQL**: For persistent storage
- **Oban**: For reliable background job processing

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- **Build Time**: < 2 minutes with Dagger
- **Startup Time**: < 5 seconds
- **Memory Footprint**: 72MB baseline
- **Request Latency**: < 50ms overhead
- **Throughput**: 1000+ req/s per instance

## 🔮 What's Next

- GraphQL API completion
- Multi-provider load balancing improvements
- Enhanced monitoring and observability
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Distributed tracing support
